//! Reaching the `tinyconnectors` module.
//!
//! The connector implementation — the Composio client, the OAuth handoff, the
//! execute pipeline, the trigger archive, the sync providers — lives in the
//! `tinyconnectors` module, not in this crate. This is how the host calls it.
//!
//! # What stays here
//!
//! Three things deliberately did not move, and callers must keep applying them
//! around these calls:
//!
//! - **Egress policy.** [`crate::openhuman::security::egress`] refuses outbound
//!   tool calls under local-only mode and discloses every external transfer.
//!   That is host policy about the *user's* data, and the module cannot see the
//!   reasons behind it. Apply it before calling [`methods::EXECUTE`].
//! - **Which route to use.** Whether the user is signed in, whether they
//!   supplied their own Composio key, and which the product prefers are all
//!   decisions this crate makes. They become the module's configuration blob,
//!   and the module honours it rather than choosing.
//! - **Webhook delivery.** The backend HMAC-verifies Composio webhooks and fans
//!   them out over the user's sockets. The module has no socket, so the
//!   existing trigger subscriber keeps its job.
//!
//! # What the module now owns
//!
//! Scope enforcement. `ListTools` hides what the user's preference forbids and
//! `Execute` refuses it. Do **not** re-filter here against a separately stored
//! preference: two sources of truth for a permission is how one of them ends up
//! stale and permissive.
