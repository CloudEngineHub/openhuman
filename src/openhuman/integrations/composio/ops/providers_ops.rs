//! Provider-backed ops: profile fetch, identity refresh, and sync.
//!
//! # The division of labour
//!
//! Reading a connected account is the module's job — it holds the credential,
//! the provider registry, and the paging cursors. Writing what it read into
//! memory is this crate's, because the memory driver is bound here and the
//! guard that redacts and taints a batch sits in front of it.
//!
//! So a sync is two calls: `Sync` returns records, and the bound driver's
//! `accept_source_items` ingests them. Neither half knows about the other,
//! which is the point — the module cannot reach the user's memory, and the
//! memory driver never sees a Composio credential.
