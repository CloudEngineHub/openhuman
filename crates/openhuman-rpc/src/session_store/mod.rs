//! The on-disk session store the app, the CLI and the TUI install.
//!
//! [`SqliteSessionStores`] is a
//! [`SessionStoreProvider`](tinyagents_session::port::SessionStoreProvider)
//! over the layout OpenHuman has always written under its workspace:
//!
//! ```text
//! {workspace}/session_raw/*.jsonl                         transcripts
//! {workspace}/session_db/sessions.db                      run ledger (SQLite)
//! {workspace}/memory/conversations/turn_states/…          turn snapshots
//! {workspace}/tinyagents_store/{kv,journal}/              run status, goals,
//!                                                         todos, turn journal
//! ```
//!
//! The desktop app, the CLI and the TUI install it ([`install`]). The core
//! and the embed facade reach session state through the port, and keep a
//! fallback to the same files only for hosts that install no store.
//!
//! It serves one operator: every agent shares the workspace, as it always
//! has, so it does not claim the per-agent isolation a multi-user host's
//! store must provide.
//!
//! The workspace is resolved on every call rather than fixed at
//! construction, because the desktop rebinds it when a different user signs
//! in.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use openhuman_rpc::session_store::SqliteSessionStores;
//! use tinyagents_session::port::SessionStoreProvider;
//!
//! let dir = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
//! let stores = SqliteSessionStores::at(dir.path());
